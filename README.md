Phase 1: Get the File Ready
Create a Folder: Go to your Desktop (or Documents) and create a new folder named weather-app.

Create the File: Open the folder, right-click, select New > Text Document, and name it index.html.

Note: If you don't see ".html", you might need to enable "File name extensions" in your computer's view settings.

Paste the Code: Open that file, paste the code I gave you (or the code from your GitHub), and save it.

Phase 2: Open in VS Code
Open Visual Studio Code.

Go to File (top left) -> Open Folder...

Select the weather-app folder you just created.

Click the index.html file on the left sidebar to see your code in the editor.

Phase 3: Install "Live Server" Extension
This is the special tool that makes your browser update automatically and simulates a real website environment.

Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (it looks like four squares with one floating away).

In the search bar, type: Live Server.

Look for the first result by Ritwick Dey.

Click the blue Install button.

Phase 4: Run Your Website
Go back to your index.html file in the editor so you can see the code.

Right-click anywhere in the code area.

Select Open with Live Server from the menu.

Your default web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) will automatically pop up showing your working website!
